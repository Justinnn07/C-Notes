- loops are used to repeat a similar part of the code snippet repeatedly

- types of Loops

  1.While Loops

  2.Do- While loops

  3.For Loops

- increment => i++, ++i
- decrement => i--, --i

- i+++ => DOES NOT EXIST
- += => COMPOUND

- do while loop => similar as while loop

  do {

  }while();

while => checks the condition and runs the code

do-while => check the code & then checks the condition

- For loop => for(initialize; test; increment/decrement){
  // code
  // code
  // code
  }

- In Case of Decrementing for loop
  for(i = 5; i; i--){
  // code
  }

- in this case i is said to br true in the place of test

- break => THIS IS USE TO EXIT THE LOOP WHETHER IT IS TRUE OR FALSE
